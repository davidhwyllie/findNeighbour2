Endpoints
=========

Endpoint | Function | Example responses | Note | cf. EW1 | 
---      | ---      | ---               | --- | ---  |
/server_config | returns the server config file | {"DESCRIPTION":"A test server operating in on localhost for tb testing","PORT":8184, "IP":"127.0.0.1",  ...., "LOGLEVEL":"INFO"	} | Allows identification of what server is on what port; however, may contain highly sensitive internal information, including database passwords; disable outside a trusted setting | New in EW2 |
/server time | returns the server's internal time | {"server_time": "2017-04-27T11:51:35.771625"} | Mainly useful to test server availability |
/server_memory_usage | returns memory usage by the server process |{"memory_units": "bytes", "maximum_resident_set_size": 34840052, "note": "Values are as returned by the python3 resource module for the server process only.  Please see https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html for more information"} |  Memory used by other processes e.g. databases is not included.  The statistic returned is the 'maximum ever' memory usage by the server.  Current memory usage may be smaller. | New in findNeigh2 |
/insert	| inserts a sample called *sname* containing a mapped DNA sequence *dna* | ['OK'] | Parameters are in *italics*.  Please see docs for example client code to use the xmlrpc server. | Identical query and response from both versions | 
/exist_sample | check whether the sample identified by guid *sname* exists in the server.  | {'True'} or {'False'} |  Only guids are accepted as identifiers | Identical query and response from both versions |
/query_get_value_snp_filter | identify *sname*'s neighbours closer than *snpDistance* iff the neighbours have a quality score more than *cutoff*.  Two *format*s are possible, 1 and 2.  1 is the default, and is compatible with Elephantwalk. | Format 1:  ["OK", [["fc3b2c0b-1886-4ff9-8d67-6d6f7674a910"], ["b1a2bfa3-3609-46ad-be8b-3dc059722128"]]] or ['Bad', 'bad sequence']; 42 Format 2:  ["OK", [["fc3b2c0b-1886-4ff9-8d67-6d6f7674a910", 2, 28701, 29410, 34433], ["b1a2bfa3-3609-46ad-be8b-3dc059722128", 2, 33687, 29410, 39088]]] or ['Bad','bad sequence'] | -  | Use *format*=1 (or omit a *format* parameter) for compatibility with EW1.  EW2 returns, if *format* = 2, additional information related to Ns in sequences. |
/get_all_guids | list of guids in the server | [ {"guid": "7b2a6689-add4-4795-8955-7a56d48710e6"}, .... , {"guid": "987ee0ba-c65a-4747-9419-42c0dfc3909d"}, {"guid": "dd14c0fd-12bb-472c-9917-c66cd28631e7"}, {"guid": "8667eca5-ba7f-4aa2-8df0-4e1f36689b49"}]] | - | Identical in both versions |
/get_all_filtered_guids | list of guids in the server with quality score (proportion of Ns) more than *cutoff*  | ["3564e811-380e-43be-9455-54ad5081ba0b", "4681f9ae-aa1f-4dc0-97cb-3bfaed5de812", ... , "c759c44d-9072-436c-8de5-59ab70f0d82b", "4ae516cc-eeef-40ea-806c-4f35a3860e4d"] | - | Identical in both versions |
/get_all_guids_examination_time | list of all guids on the server and their examination times  | {"guid": "987ee0ba-c65a-4747-9419-42c0dfc3909d", "examinationTime": "2017-04-12T02:20:06.296760"}, {"guid": "dd14c0fd-12bb-472c-9917-c66cd28631e7", "examinationTime": "2017-04-12T02:20:09.573247"}, {"guid": "8667eca5-ba7f-4aa2-8df0-4e1f36689b49", "examinationTime": "2017-04-12T02:20:12.275453"}] | - | Identical in both versions |
/get_all_annotations | all meta data on all samples | json object containing a list of guid: metadata dictionaries | Returned object is large, and query is relatively slow. | Identical between both versions | 
/get_detail | returns positions of variation between *guid1* and *guid2* | json object containing positions of variation in both samples | Query is fast ( ~ 50msec per comparison), and includes information on all variation between the two sequences | New in EW2; not supported by EW1. |
